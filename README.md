# OctaneOS

> The operating system powering the Octane open source retro gaming handheld platform.

OctaneOS is a custom Linux distribution forked from [Batocera Linux](https://batocera.org), extended with hardware support for the Allwinner A733 SoC and built from the ground up for the Octane handheld platform.

Every Octane runs OctaneOS. Every OctaneOS is open source. Every update ships to every Octane in the world from [GameOctane.com](https://gameoctane.com).

## What is Octane?

Octane is an open source retro gaming handheld you build yourself. Not just a device — a platform.

- **$150 weekend build** that competes with $300 commercial handhelds
- **Three play modes** — handheld, docked, and wireless streaming
- **Universal dock** — HDMI, Component, and Composite outputs simultaneously
- **RetroAchievements** baked in and configured out of the box
- **Streetpass-style** passive community interactions over WiFi
- **100% open source** — hardware, software, STL files, everything

> *Build It. Play It. Own It.*

## What makes OctaneOS different?

Batocera is an incredible foundation. OctaneOS builds on top of it with features that will never exist in generic Batocera — because they only make sense on Octane hardware.

| Feature | Batocera | OctaneOS |
|---|---|---|
| Allwinner A733 support | ❌ | ✅ |
| Three mode system | ❌ | ✅ |
| Dual-radio WiFi — internet + streaming simultaneously | ❌ | ✅ |
| Cover art dock mode | ❌ | ✅ |
| Achievement overlay on device screen | ❌ | ✅ |
| Wireless streaming stack | ❌ | ✅ |
| Streetpass daemon | ❌ | ✅ |
| GameOctane companion app | ❌ | ✅ |
| OTA updates from GameOctane.com | ❌ | ✅ |
| Cart reader support (Phase 3) | ❌ | ✅ |
| RetroAchievements | ✅ | ✅ |
| EmulationStation frontend | ✅ | ✅ |
| RetroArch + cores | ✅ | ✅ |
| Controller auto-detection | ✅ | ✅ |

## Target Hardware

OctaneOS is built for the **Radxa Cubie A7S** with the Allwinner A733 SoC.

| Component | Spec |
|---|---|
| SoC | Allwinner A733 |
| CPU | 2× Cortex-A76 + 6× Cortex-A55 @ 2.0GHz |
| GPU | Imagination PowerVR BXM-4-64 MC1 |
| RAM | 6GB LPDDR5 |
| WiFi | WiFi 6 (802.11ax) |
| Bluetooth | 5.4 |
| Display out | USB-C DisplayPort Alt Mode |
| GPIO | 30-pin + 15-pin headers |

Full hardware specification available in the [Octane Platform Spec v1.3](docs/Octane_Platform_Spec_v1_3.pdf).

## Three Play Modes

OctaneOS manages three distinct play modes automatically — no configuration required.

**Handheld** — battery powered, screen shows the game, full controls active.

**Docked** — single USB-C cable carries DisplayPort video to TV and charges simultaneously. Octane screen switches to cover art and achievement notification mode.

**Wireless Streaming** — Octane stays in your hands. Game streams over a dedicated WiFi 6 radio (wlan1) to the dock. A second independent radio (wlan0) keeps the home network connection live — RetroAchievements, OTA updates, and netplay all work during streaming. Octane screen becomes a companion display.
