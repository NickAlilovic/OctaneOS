## Why this exists
A $150 weekend build that anyone can make, own completely, and runs every retro game — open source from silicon to firmware.

## Strategic picture
OctaneOS is the foundation everything else in GameOctane sits on. GPU hardware acceleration just shipped. EmulationStation is running smooth. First ROM (Doom) confirmed playing with a controller. The platform is real. Next: RetroAchievements out of the box, three mode system, and OTA updates.

## Next up
- [ ] Audio — verify aplay -l shows allwinner-edp card on v0.5.5
- [ ] RetroAchievements configured out of the box
- [ ] Three mode system (handheld / docked / wireless streaming)
- [ ] OTA update system from GameOctane.com
- [ ] GameOctane companion app integration
- [ ] 8BitDo controller disconnect fix (intermittent, ~130s interval — likely controller sleep timer)
- [ ] Suppress spurious DP-1 hotplug events from sunxi-drm BSP
- [ ] Audio — aplay -l returns no soundcards; machine driver failing (simple_dai_link_of errors)

## What just shipped (v0.5.4-alpha)
Bash shell, US keyboard layout, AXP8191 clean shutdown, audio drivers in (SND_SOC_SUNXI_CODEC_AV=m). Audio still not working — see v0.5.5 fix below.

## What's in v0.5.5-alpha (building now)
**Audio fix (root cause)**: SND_SOC_SUNXI_CODEC_AV had no MODULE_ALIAS in the BSP source — udev could never auto-load it when the DRM EDP driver created the platform device. Machine driver hit EPROBE_DEFER forever. Fix: added MODULE_ALIAS("platform:sunxi-snd-codec-av") to snd_sunxi_codec_av.c so depmod generates the alias and udev triggers modprobe at the right moment.

**batocera-info CPU display**: Script showed "CPU Cores: 6" on A733 (8-core). Bug: sysfs fallback used physical_package_id (all 0 on single-SoC ARM) + core_id — A76 core_ids 0-1 collided with A55 core_ids 0-1 → 6 unique pairs. Fix: try cluster_id first (A55=0, A76=1). Now shows 8 cores + two clusters with correct frequencies.

## Resume here
v0.5.5-alpha building. Verify: aplay -l shows allwinner-edp card, CPU Cores shows 8, CPU Cluster 1: 6 cores @ 1800 MHz / CPU Cluster 2: 2 cores @ 2000 MHz.

## Last session
2026-07-07/08: Audio root cause — no MODULE_ALIAS on snd_soc_sunxi_codec_av (=y blocked by Kconfig if-block). Added MODULE_ALIAS to BSP source. batocera-info fsoverlay override for CPU core count and frequency display. Released v0.5.5-alpha.
